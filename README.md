# Mosaic 3 Components Test - CPA application

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Known issues

* The dropdown doesn't update its title on selection of an option.
* The dropdown component creates a wrapper that spans 100% even though the button isn't 100% wide - click to the side of it activates the dropdown if it's not placed in a container sized to "shrink wrap" it.
* Disabled attribute doesn't update on buttons on input of a truthy variable from the parent component.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
